Interpreting User Needs and User Stories:
I interpret user needs by actively engaging with stakeholders and end-users to understand their requirements and expectations. I aim to empathize with their goals and challenges. Creating "user stories" is an essential part of this process as they allow me to break down complex requirements into smaller, actionable components. These stories capture the user's perspective and help guide the development process by focusing on what the user wants to achieve.

Approach to Developing Programs:
My approach to developing programs is centered around iterative and collaborative practices. I believe in delivering value early and often, so I prefer breaking down projects into smaller sprints or iterations. This aligns with agile principles and allows for frequent feedback and adjustments. I also value clean code and emphasize writing code that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

Incorporating Agile Processes:
In my future development work, I hope to incorporate several agile processes that I've found effective. One is the practice of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), which streamlines development and ensures frequent releases with higher quality. I also plan to emphasize regular retrospectives to reflect on what's working well and what can be improved. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban will continue to guide my project management and development approach.

Being a Good Team Member in Software Development:
Being a good team member in software development involves effective communication, collaboration, and a commitment to shared goals. I make sure to actively participate in team discussions, provide constructive feedback, and listen to others' perspectives. I value open and transparent communication to avoid misunderstandings. I also believe in supporting my colleagues, sharing knowledge, and being adaptable to changes and challenges that arise during the development process. A good team member recognizes that success is a collective effort and strives to contribute positively to the team's overall dynamics and outcomes.




C++ CLASS
What did you do particularly well? The way I implemnted the mehods went really well 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would like to make some changes in the future to make better functions in order to simplify the code

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? The loops, and the editing of the histograms

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? I feel the creation of methods, loops, the use of time in programming very intersting and the use of if statements. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I left comments in order to make it visual and understandable. Also, I tried to simplify it as much as I could in just one file withouth using .h or another .cpp file. I coded everything in one file in the global area so in the main I just called the functions.
