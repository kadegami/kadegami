What did you do particularly well? The way I implemnted the mehods went really well 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would like to make some changes in the future to make better functions in order to simplify the code

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? The loops, and the editing of the histograms

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? I feel the creation of methods, loops, the use of time in programming very intersting and the use of if statements. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I left comments in order to make it visual and understandable. Also, I tried to simplify it as much as I could in just one file withouth using .h or another .cpp file. I coded everything in one file in the global area so in the main I just called the functions.
